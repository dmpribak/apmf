# All-Pairs Max-Flow Algorithms
A survey of three different approaches for the all-pairs max-flow algorithm: Ford-Fulkerson on all pairs, Dinitz's algorithm on all pairs, and the original algorithm for Gomory-Hu Tree.
Each algorithm was implemented and benchmarked. More details can be found in the presentation and report.
